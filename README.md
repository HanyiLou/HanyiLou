- 👋 Hi, I’m Hanyi Lou
- 👀 I’m interested in all things cute and delicious. I love seeking out new cuisines and experimenting with cooking.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a bit of everything that catches my interest—it’s broad and varied, so I can’t pin it down to one specific area!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve creativity, technology, or anything that combines fun with functionality.
- 📫 How to reach me: If you have any cool projects or just want to share some foodie experiences, drop me a line at louhanyi@foxmail.com.
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can spot a cute item from a mile away and have an uncanny ability to find the best food spots in any city!
